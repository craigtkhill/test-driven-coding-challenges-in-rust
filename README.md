A repository for learning about Rust, data structures and algorithms.

I'm currently working through the [Rust by Practice](https://practice.course.rs/why-exercise.html) course.

_To quickly check if your code compiles use_

```bash
cargo check
```

_Format code before commiting_

```bash
cargo fmt
```

_Build and run using_

```bash
cargo run
```

_To compile a build with optimizations use_

```bash
cargo build --release
```

main.rs is always the first executable.
