A repository for learning about Rust through test driven coding challenges.

I'm currently working through the [Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges) C++ challenges.

First run the `cargo test` to ensure the tests are failing.
Then update the code in the function.
Rerun `cargo test` to ensure the code works correctly.
